"""A position-driven third-person chase camera.

The live path planner feeds a STREAM of agent positions — the camera must not
assume the path's shape (a circle, a spline, anything). ``ChaseCamera`` estimates
the travel direction from a *smoothed velocity* of the incoming positions and
critically damps the camera pose toward a trailing target, so the view eases
smoothly even when the raw direction is noisy or snaps around.

It is pure math — no rendering, no volrover3, no assumption about the path. Feed
it ``update(pos, dt)`` and read back an ``(eye, target, up)`` to drive any camera
(in volrover3, write those into the ``volrover3.camera`` state tree; see
``examples/volrover_lab_animated.py``).

Robustness for real input:
  * two-stage smoothing — a light EMA on position (kills jitter) feeds a heavier
    EMA on the velocity estimate (a stable heading);
  * frame-rate independent — every smoothing factor is ``1 - exp(-dt/tau)``, so
    irregular tick spacing doesn't change the feel;
  * stop-safe — below ``min_speed`` the last good heading is held, so the camera
    doesn't spin when the agent pauses or pivots in place.
